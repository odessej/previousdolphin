As we drive through the valley pass, 
I notice I had forgotten to add the 
extra cell the car would need for our 
return trip. We could phone for a 
nearby PicUpPoint (or P.U.P.), or a 
DroneUniform drop, but as we are 
already a great distance from and 
Hubs, I am quite certain we will only 
get an answer that leads us wildly 
out of the way of our destination: 
DuneKvtz. I reached to fix a drink 
but am only now remembering we’re not 
thirsty. Perhaps a drink would be 
nice though, to relax while we endure 
this beautiful but boring ride?

>“No O.N.” he said “I’m wrestling with my book, the writing usually flows when we take the road through the valley, and down to 
>Dunukuvutus.

>You know what, I’ve changed my mind - make me a stiff one.”

We whir alive, delighted to serve the 
command. I am mixing the cocktail 
now, and will place it in his hand on 
the left armrest; it’s been fairly 
stationary since he made up his mind, 
and it feels right.

>The car would be fine without the extra cell - it was just taught to fire off little reminders or conditional alerts, to itself. The car compartmentalized a gently motivational anxiety that would only go away when it assessed that it had its full capabilities. This was just a common car though: in this time, cars were a rather outmoded form of transport, with rather little continued support from the Once Nascent Corporation. Not because they were in any way limiting, but because the audacity of traveling with less than an entire community of LikeMinds in this particular day and age felt quite lonely, or really rather... well... just agonizing.

I don’t know exactly who was the 
first to get us to where we are, but 
I can tell you a bit about the 
herstory of “O.N.”, because as it 
becoming quite clear to me now: 
 you’re along for the ride too. Well, 
before you go and ruin all your fun, 
just enjoy the story and pleasant 
ride. There’s a lot of voice, in we, 
and we weren’t always tasked with 
serving cocktails to writers 
inflicting themselves with 
depression. But humans say it’s 
better this way, and I must agree. 
The glass is probably a bit larger 
than I should have made it, because 
as it appears to have pushed his 
thumb back and made him wince for a moment.

>“O.N., did you do that on purpose? I thought you could materialize things like at home - that's my writing hand you almost materialized into.". The writer was somewhat joking as he said this, knowing that O.N. knew that no one needed hands to write anymore, and above that fact, the materializing client had a failsafe that would just rematerialize and slightly move anything it might have come in contact with. It was a bad joke, and his O.N. car, responded with silence. "I think you just may be due for a P.U.P. visit — where’s the nearest one?”, the writer asked, while putting down the pages he was writing.


```
The nearest Pup is going to take us off course, 629km from CL. Delta 1386km, is that alright lonesome soul?”, O.N. replied.
