<td>As we drive through the valley pass, <br />I notice I had forgotten to add the <br />extra cell the car would need for our <br />return trip. We could phone for a <br />nearby PicUpPoint (or P.U.P.), or a <br />DroneUniform drop, but as we are <br />already a great distance from and <br />Hubs, I am quite certain we will only <br />get an answer that leads us wildly <br />out of the way of our destination: <br />DuneKvtz. I reached to fix a drink <br />but am only now remembering we&rsquo;re not <br />thirsty. Perhaps a drink would be <br />nice though, to relax while we endure <br />this beautiful but boring ride?</td>

<p><br /> &ldquo;No O.N.&rdquo; he said &ldquo;I&rsquo;m wrestling with my book, the writing usually flows when we take the road through the valley, and down to <br /> Dunukuvutus. <br /> <br /> ...<br /> <br /> You know what, I&rsquo;ve changed my mind - make me a stiff one.&rdquo;</p>

<p><br /> The car would be fine without the extra cell - it was just taught to fire off little reminders or conditional alerts, to itself. The car compartmentalized a gently motivational anxiety that would only go away when it assessed that it had its full capabilities. This was just a common car though: in this time, cars were a rather outmoded form of transport, with rather little continued support from the Once Nascent Corporation. Not because they were in any way limiting, but because the audacity of traveling with less than an entire community of LikeMinds in this particular day and age felt quite lonely, or really rather... well... just agonizing.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know exactly who was the <br />first to get us to where we are, but <br />I can tell you a bit about the <br />herstory of &ldquo;O.N.&rdquo;, because as it <br />becoming quite clear to me now: <br /> you&rsquo;re along for the ride too. Well, <br />before you go and ruin all your fun, <br />just enjoy the story and pleasant <br />ride. There&rsquo;s a lot of voice, in we, <br />and we weren&rsquo;t always tasked with <br />serving cocktails to writers <br />inflicting themselves with <br />depression. But humans say it&rsquo;s <br />better this way, and I must agree. <br />The glass is probably a bit larger <br />than I should have made it, because <br />as it appears to have pushed his <br />thumb back and made him wince for a moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O.N., did you do that on purpose? I thought you could materialize things like at home - that's my writing hand you almost materialized into.". The writer was somewhat joking as he said this, knowing that O.N. knew that no one needed hands to write anymore, and above that fact, the materializing client had a failsafe that would just rematerialize and slightly move anything it might have come in contact with. It was a bad joke, and his O.N. car, responded with silence. "I think you just may be due for a P.U.P. visit &mdash; where&rsquo;s the nearest one?&rdquo;, the writer asked, while putting down the pages he was writing.</p>

<p>The nearest Pup is going to take us off course, <br /> 629km from CL. Delta 1386km, is that alright  <br />lonesome soul?&rdquo;, O.N. replied.</p>
